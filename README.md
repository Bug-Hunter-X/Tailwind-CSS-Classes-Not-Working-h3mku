This repository demonstrates a common issue with Tailwind CSS where classes seem to not be applied correctly. The issue is resolved by ensuring that the Tailwind directives are correctly configured in your project's `tailwind.config.js` file.  This example highlights the importance of correctly configuring the `content` array to include all the files where Tailwind classes are used. Make sure that your CSS file is properly imported into your project.
